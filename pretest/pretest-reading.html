        <p>Many people in the city enjoy spending time outdoors, and one of the most popular places to relax is the city park. Located in the center of town, Greenfield Park is open every day and is free for everyone to enjoy. Families often visit the park on weekends to have picnics, ride bicycles, or simply enjoy the fresh air.</p><br>
        <p>The park has a playground for children, walking paths, and a small lake with ducks and fish. People can rent paddle boats or feed the ducks from the wooden bridge. In the evenings, joggers and walkers use the trails, and some people even bring their dogs for a walk. On Sundays, there is usually live music at the open-air stage.</p><br>
        <p>Greenfield Park is also home to many trees and flowers. During spring and summer, the park becomes colorful with blooming plants. The city takes care of the park by cleaning the area and planting new trees every year. It is a place where nature and the city come together, making it a favorite spot for both residents and visitors.</p><br>

    <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mt-12 mb-2">Passage 2: The Invention of Paper</h3>
        <p>Paper is one of the most important inventions in human history. Before paper was created, people wrote on materials like stone, animal skins, or bamboo. These materials were often heavy, expensive, or difficult to carry. Around 105 A.D., a Chinese official named Cai Lun developed a new method to make paper from tree bark, old rags, and fishing nets. His invention spread quickly across China and eventually to the rest of the world.</p><br>
        <p>As paper-making technology improved, it became easier and cheaper to produce. In the 8th century, the knowledge of paper-making spread to the Middle East through trade and war. By the 12th century, Europe had its own paper mills. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century by Johannes Gutenberg increased the demand for paper even more. Books, newspapers, and letters became more common, and knowledge spread faster than ever before.</p><br>
        <p>Today, paper is used in almost every part of daily life—from books and packaging to money and hygiene products. Although digital devices have reduced some of its use, paper remains a valuable material. Efforts are now being made to recycle paper and reduce deforestation. Paper’s long history shows how a simple invention can change the world.</p><br>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mt-12 mb-2">Passage 3: AI and the Future of Work</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the way we live and work. Machines with the ability to learn, solve problems, and adapt to new situations are now being used in fields ranging from healthcare to finance. For example, AI systems can analyze medical scans, recommend treatments, and even predict diseases before symptoms appear. In offices, AI-powered tools help with data management, customer service, and scheduling.</p><br>
        <p>While AI offers many benefits, it also raises concerns. One major issue is job displacement. As machines become more capable, some tasks traditionally done by humans may become automated. This could result in fewer job opportunities for certain professions, especially those involving repetitive or routine work. However, experts also point out that AI could create new types of jobs—particularly in areas that require creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving.</p><br>
        <p>To prepare for an AI-driven future, education and training systems must adapt. Workers may need to learn new skills, including digital literacy and critical thinking. Governments and businesses also have a role to play by supporting retraining programs and ensuring fair access to opportunities. While the full impact of AI on employment is still uncertain, it is clear that flexibility and lifelong learning will be essential in the years ahead.</p><br>
